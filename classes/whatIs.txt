What is Indigent?

Well, in Latin it means 'need', 'needy', or 'penniless', but don't let the name fool you.  If you allow the Indigent App to work for you, it could make you everything BUT poor.  In fact, your friends will be asking to bum rides from you and your flying Delorean… Ok, so we may have over exaggerated a bit, but you know what I mean.

The idea for Indigent started way back in the year 2012… yeah, in dog years that's like . . . a lot more than human years.  It came out of the constant struggle of forgetting to put things on a shopping list.  For instance, when you need milk, eggs, or bread, you usually remember them… usually. But there is a plethora (that's right, we said plethora) of items that get lost in the cracks and never make it to a shopping list.  When was the last time you put batteries, lightbulbs, a turkey baster, latex gloves, an Xbox 360, or a box of matches on your shopping list… To be honest, we don't need to know, and the fact that you may have purchased all of those at one time at any store, tells us that we'll never want to know.

Stop forgetting the things that you need! In a few moments it takes to register, we could save you tons of precious time and money!

Try Indigent.  It's free, and it doesn't bite!  (In most cases that's a very good thing… unless you have the shopping list mentioned above.)
