How to use Indigent

We've tried to simplify this down to the basics (as much as possible).  One side of Indigent is dedicated to keep track of items that are purchased on a fairly regular basis.  The other side of Indigent helps to keep track of your money, as it works to save for specific items that are on a wish list, created by you.  

Indigent can keep track of reoccurring purchases, as well as one time impulse buys.  It can be a very simple way to keep track of monthly expenses, but it's fully capable of offering a more robust and sophisticated experience as well.
